# The pin group and the spin group

In this file we define `lipschitz` consisting all the elements in `(clifford_algebra)Ë£` closed
under conjugation and construct `pin_group` based on `lipschitz` and `unitary`, and we construct
`spin_group` based on `pin_group` and `clifford_algebra.even`. Also, we show `pin_group` and 
`spin_group` form a group where the inverse is `star`.

## Main definitions

* `lipschitz`: the Lipschitz group with a quadratic form.
* `pin_group`: the Pin group with a quadratic form.
* `spin_group`: the Spin group with a quadratic form.
